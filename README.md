# SevenSegDisplay
This Repository holds all files necessary to wire and code an Arduino Uno properly in order to display values on a four digit seven segment display using a 74HC595 IC.

Wire Diagrams for the Ultrasonic Senore, the IC chip, and the Display can be found in WireDiagrams.

The Rest is pretty self explanatory.
